## 💾 How Data is Stored

This version uses **browser localStorage** which means:
- ✅ Data persists in the browser
- ✅ Export to CSV/Excel anytime
- ✅ Works completely offline
- ⚠️ Each computer/browser has its own data
- ⚠️ Clear browser data = lost records

**For enterprise use with centralized database, see backend setup in source repository.**

## 🔐 For Production Use

1. **Centralized Database:** Deploy the Node.js backend to Azure/AWS
